# Park-Sensor_with-frdm-kl25z

This project is a microprocessor project that aims to design a parking sensor in  C++.

In the Project, a keypad, LEDs, from-kl25z, breadboard, LCD screen, and HCSR04 were used. The user enters a distance via a keypad that determines when the sensors will start blinking. The amount of distance is calculated by the HCSR04 sensor according to the library and its respected datasheet.
