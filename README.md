# Park-Sensor_with-frdm-kl25z

This project is an microproccessor project that aims to design a ark sensor in  C++.

In the Project a keypad, LEDs,frdm-kl25z, breadboard, LCD screen, and HCSR04 was used. The user enters a distance via keypad that determines when the sensors will start blinking. The amount of distance is calculated by HCSR04 sensor according to the library and its respected datasheet.
